RISC-V 4x4 Matrix Multiplication
This program is written in RISC-V assembly language and is designed to perform 4x4 matrix multiplication. It takes two input matrices, each represented as a 4x4 array of integers, and produces the result of their multiplication as output.

Description
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and finds applications in various fields, including computer graphics, physics simulations, and machine learning. This program implements a basic matrix multiplication algorithm specifically tailored for 4x4 matrices using RISC-V assembly language.

Input Format
The input matrices should be provided in the same format as the original code, you can change the numbers to your liking.]
